I want to say that this workshop was really very much fruitful for me
and also this is an interactive and intresting workshop for
me that I had attended till now.Sir you are very sweet and unique person.
The special thing of yours is that you never
take the credits for the good works you had done.
In workshops, i generally saw that
trainee start lagging in their works due to
less interaction by mentor but in this workshop because of your sweet nature
no one is afraid or hesitate of asking their
problems and this is the reason that
everyone standing at the same lavel,you answer the questions
with much clarity every time irrespect of time it is asked by u.
once again thankyou so much sir.You are one of the best mentor.""")
